# A_Hash_Based_Visual_Cryptography_Scheme
Abstractâ€” This paper describes the implementation of an anti-phishing framework with the help of visual cryptography. In this method we test the server that is under test through image-based authentication which is secured and safe. A secret random image that is to be transmitted is encoded into two shares, called client share and server share. It involves the client and server storing their respective shares and then overlapping them to produce the original secret image thus authenticating the required side.
